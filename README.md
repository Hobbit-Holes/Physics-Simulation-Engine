## Introduction

This project consists of creating our own graphic engine from scratch, for it, in this repository you can find and show the functionalities that we will be adding. These can be mathematical functions, such as adding vectors between them, to graphics rendering functions and much more. The main goal is to be able to create videogames, focusing in 2 dimensional view.

## Game Loop

For this firt part of the course and the begining of the creating of the game engine, we have make some game loops to understand how it works. All this can be seen in the folder [Game Loops](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/Game-Loops) where we have created some folder per each game loop learn in the course. As the course progresses, the same loops will be created but with the structure of the game engine.

## Project Architecture

The creating of a game engine is difficult, so it is so important to have the project well structured and don't commit errors or redundance. The idea is to separate in different files <i>(Classes and structures)</i> the physics, graphics, inputs, etc. Here we have to create a class to handle and rule <i>(like the One Ring)</i> all the functionalities, classes and other stuff, in our case, we have called our game engine <b><code>MorgulEngine</code></b>.

Some of these classes are the <code>Graphics</code> or the <code>Logger</code>. The first one handle the visual aspects of the screen, per example: 

- <b>Open Window</b>
- <b>Close Window</b>
- <b>Render Frame</b>
- Etc

And the second one give us information of the process during the execution of the game engine. When the message appear, it also show us the time that occurs. There are three main types that are: 

- <b>Info</b>: The information displayed will appear in green.
- <b>Warning</b>: The information displayed will appear in yellow.
- <b>Error</b>: The information displayed will appear in red.

## Color

In this section we have implemented a functionality where the engine can manage the colors of the screen when it draw lines, forms, polygons and even the background. Here we have create two files named <b><code>Color.hh</code></b> and <b><code>Color.cpp</code></b> which have the following functions:

- <b>Constructor and Deconstructor</b>: It create the Color in different ways <i>(Without parameters, with the RGB or RGBA parameters and Hexadecimal parameter)</i>.
- <b>Transformation</b>: It make some variations to the Colors, making it darker, ligther or get a Color between two Colors, amon other things.
- <b>Operators</b>: It show in a easy way the values of the Color and merge two Colors.
- <b>Basic colors</b>: This are some basic Color which the user can use without introducing the RGBA or Hexadecimal values.

In this section there is a example called [Bootstrap](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/bootstrap) that draw a filled rectangle with the struct created. The result obtained is the folllowing: 

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/blob/main/Screenshots/Bootstrap.gif" alt="Bootstrap" height="300"/></p>

## Rendering Primitives

At this point we know how to draw some pixels with Colors, but we need to improve the techniques to draw figures and polygons. So, in this section, we have learn how to draw any polygon from scratch. This is drawing lines drawed by pixels. Some types of draws are the following: 

- <b>Grid</b>: Grid the screen so that you can better see where an object will be, if needed.
- <b>Line</b>: Draw a series of pizels given a start poiint and a end point.
- <b>Rectangles</b>: Draw 4 lines given the vertices and can be filled or not.
- <b>Polygons</b>: Draw geometric forms with lines and can be filled or not.
- <b>Circles</b>: Draw a circle given the radius and can be filled or not.

All these functions have been added to the <code>Graphics</code> files. In this section we have had an exercise <i>([Exercise 04](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/exercise-04))</i> where we have to scaffold our game engine and render some shapes and a grid, while we obtain some information with the <code>Logger</code>. The result is as follows: 

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/blob/main/Screenshots/Exercise04.gif" alt="Exercise 04" height="300"/></p>

## Vectors

Here, we have created the files <code>Vec2.hh</code> and <code>Vec2.cpp</code> to add our custom Vectors of 2 dimensions to our game engine. With these vectors we can manage the data in a easier way, per example, when we want to do some calculus between vectors or to determine the position of a object. Inside the scripts, there are functions and operators. Some of the functions are: 

- <b>Sume, subtraction, multiplication...</b>.
- <b>Magnitude, Normal, Lerp...</b>
- <b>Dot, Cross...</b>

And some of the operators are: 

- <b>=, == , !=</b>
- <b>+, -, *, /, Inverse</b>
- <b>+=, -=, *=, /=</b>

By this point we have seen the example [Vectors 01](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/vectors-01) where we can check the good behaviour of our code and also, we have to do the exercise [Exercise 05](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/exercise-05) where we have to define more operators and functions. The new functions and operators are the following:

- <b>Angle</b>: It calculate the angle between two vectors. The another angle function only calculate it between the vector and the x axis.
- <b>FromModuleAngle</b>: It create a vector given the module and the angle.
- <b>Projection</b>: We obtain the projection of our principal vector into a given one.
- <b>Scalar Projection</b>: Give us the scalar value of the projection define above.
- <b>Orthonormal Projection</b>: It is the normal projection of the projection of a vector into another.

With all these function, operations and operators we can do some problems with more complexity, like the example [Vectors 02](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/vectors-02). In this example, we have two objects, the player and a enemy. The enemy will go against the player depending in the direction that the player and the enemy are. The speed of the enemy can variate because it depends only in the direction, and this vector can be larger or shorter dependind in the distance with the player. 

This is resolve in the [Exercise 06](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/exercise-06) where the speed of the enemy is constant because we use the unit vector of the direction. Also, the player is moved with the mouse thanks to the SDL. The result obtained is as follow: 

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/blob/main/Screenshots/Exercise06.gif" alt="Exercise 06" height="300"/></p>

At this point, we can also make a more difficult game. In the [Exercise 07](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/exercise-07) we have to create a mechanic where the enemy can only chase the player if the player is in front of him <i>(With a 180ยบ FOV)</i>. Finally, for this exercise we have use a variable that change the FOV grades of the enemy. The result obtained is:

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/blob/main/Screenshots/Exercise07.gif" alt="Exercise 07" height="300"/></p>

To finish with this unit on vectors, we have carried out some more examples. One is about a object moving accross the screen with a random desviation that make the object travel with noise <i>([Random Rotation](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/random-rotation))</i>. Another one is about the same logic that the mentioned before, but the object chase the player with additional logic <i>([Steering Rocket](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/steering-rocket))</i>. Finally, the last examples we have made are about the vectors, in the first one <i>([Vectors 03](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/vectors-03))</i> we have the vertex of a cube that rotate in a direction, and in the last example <i>([Vectors 04](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/vectors-03))</i> we have different objects whose behaviour varies thanks to the <code>MathUtils</code> library that we have create, making the movement go at different speeds but reaching the objective at the same time. The results of the last two examples are: 

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/blob/main/Screenshots/Vectors03.gif" alt="Vectors 03" height="300"/></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/blob/main/Screenshots/Vectors04.gif" alt="Vectors 04" height="300"/></p>

## Entity Component System

In this part we have created a system no manage the objects in a easier way. This approach, the Entity Component System, will let us create objects and apply some physics, transformations and more. We have two parts, the components with the information of th eobject and the system that manage these components. The first component we have created is <code>TransformComponent</code>, which gets the position, scale and rotation of a particular object.

By this point we have seen two examples: [TrasformComponent 01](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/transform-component-01) and [TrasformComponent 02](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/transform-component-02) where we can check the good behaviour of our code and also, we have to do the exercise [Exercise 08](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/exercise-08) where we have to implement de library EnTT to our proyect in order to be able to register and use the entities to be able to use the components and systems we have created. And finally, we have to add the ESC paradigm to be able to use all the above. The result obtained is:

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/blob/main/Screenshots/Exercise08.gif" alt="Exercise 08" height="300"/></p>

## Physics

The physics will manage the accelerations, velocity and displacement of the objects. To calculate the different variables, we have create the <code>KinematicComponent</code> and <code>KinematicSystem</code>, and in each iteration, the system will calculate the new positions and velocities. We have done two examples, the first one <i>([Gravity](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/gravity))</i> consist in applying an acceleration in the vertical axis and make the ball go up and then down. The second example <i>([Projectile](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/projectile))</i> consist in dropping a ball in a diagonal direction with an initial velocity, and when this ball reach the ground and the wall will stop it and don't fall.

Finaly, we have to do the [Exercise 09](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/exercise-09) where we apply the Kinematic component and system to manage the acceleration into velocity and position. We have create so many entities / balls that goes in different directions <i>(The number of balls can be modified in the execution and use the ECS paradigm)</i>, and when the ball touch the ground or the wall, its color will change, and when the ball can't move it, the color will cahnge again. Here, we can observe how it works when we have 20 particles:

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/blob/main/Screenshots/Exercise09.gif" alt="Exercise 09" height="300"/></p>

## Force

In this section we have learn more about the forces that can interact with the particles. These forces will change the acceleration of the particles depending also in the mass of itself. In order to archive this we have create the <code>Particle Component</code> that handles the particle physics and the rendering. To understand how it works we have done an example <i>([Wind Force](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/wind-force))</i> where two particles travel accross the screen depending a wind force that change the direction and acceleration of them. 

Because there are different types of forces whose behaviours and calculations, we have create a <code>Force</code> structure to colect some of them: 

- <b>Gravitational</b>: Every object with mass experiments a force with other objects. To obtain the force vector we need the position and mass of the objects, the Gravitational coefficient <i>(G)</i> and the minimum and maximum distance of interaction.
- <b>Drag</b>: It is a resistive force opposite of the direction of an object that depends on velocity. We need the velocity of the particle and the coefficient of drag <i>(k)</i>.
- <b>Friction</b>: Similar to the drag force, but it only affects the object if it is moving. We need the friction coefficient <i>(i)</i> and the velocity of the particle.
- <b>Magnus</b>: It is a force that is generated when an object travels through air and it is perpendicular to the flow velocity, making the object to rotate. We need the coefficient of Magnus <i>(k)</i>, the velocity of the object and his angular velocity.
- <b>Spring</b>: This force is calculated with the Hooke's law, where the force of the spring is proportional to the displacement of itself. We need the position of the object and the spring, the length of the spring and the coefficient.

For each force we have made same examples to check the proper functioning of the helpers, the examples we have made are: [Gravitational Force](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/gravitational-force), [Drag Force](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/drag-force), [Projectile Drag](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/projectile-drag), [Friction Force](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/friction-force), [Magnus Force](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/magnus-force) and [Spring Force](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/spring-force). Finally, we have the [Exercise 10](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/exercise-10) where we have to implement the forces mentionated before and create a chain of particles using the spring force. In this chain, the head of it is arrached to the anchor and the rest of the aprticles are connected with each other. The result is as follows: 

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/blob/main/Screenshots/Exercise10.gif" alt="Exercise 10" height="300"/></p>

## Numerical Integration

Sometimes, the forces applied to an object are not constant, making the results of the calculations inaccurate. Until now, we have use the Euler method, but here are others like <b>Explicit Euler</b> which it is a first order numerical procedure. Another method is the <b>Semi-implicit Euler</b> which it is modification of the previous one but with better results. The last one we have seen is the <code>Runge-Kutta</code> method that consist of determining the position zn +1 at a future time instant tn + ฮ๐ก, where ฮ๐ก is the time increment, given the position zn, velocity at a known time instant tn.

While we have try the different methods we have create some examples to understand how they work and select the one we prefer for our game engine. These examples are [Explicit Euler](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/explicit-euler) and [Runge-Kutta](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/runge-kutta).

## Soft Bodies

The Soft Bodies are visually realistic physical simulations with deformations, where the shape of the bodies can change. The approach that we have use is the spring/mas model with the verlet integration. This integration consist in calculate the position with the forces and considering the previous position.

In this unit we have two examples, the first one <i>([Soft Bodies](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/softbody))</i> consist in a body falling and touching the floor. The second one <i>([Cloth](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/cloth))</i> is more complex, he have a cloth that it is simulation like a real one.

## Rigid Bodies

Until this point, we have being working with particles, but maybe, we want to manage other types of variables like center of mass, inertia, etc. So we will work with Rigid Bodies that doesn't have deformations. To archive this we have create the <code>RigidBodyComponent</code> and the <code>RigidBodySystem</code>, and we have actualize the Kinemtic Component to be able to calculate the angular velocity and acceleration. 

Depending on the shape of the body, some calculations can be different, so we have create a <code>Shape</code> library. With this library we can create the following shapes:

- <b>Circles</b> <i>(Filled and not filled)</i>
- <b>Rectangles</b> <i>(Filled and not filled)</i>
- <b>Regular Polygons</b> <i>(Not filled)</i>
- <b>Stars</b> <i>(Not filled)</i>

For this section we have made an example <i>([Rigidboby Shapes](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/rigidbody-shapes))</i> where we have four shapes, a circle and a rectangle not filled that rotate because we apply a torque, and a circle and a rectangle filled that don't move. And finally, we have the [Exercise 11](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/exercise-11) where we have to control the orientation of the objects with the keyboard and add some objects, the result is as follows:

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/blob/main/Screenshots/Exercise11.gif" alt="Exercise 11" height="300"/></p>

## Event Bus

In some situations we want to be notified when some type of action occours <i>(Collisions, key pressed, resize og window...)</i>, to check this, there are two different ways. The first one consists in a passive check where we don't procces any event until the system check if there is something. The another way it is by blocking and making the event be checked by the system.

With the library of <b>EnTT</b> we have some functionalities / <b>Events</b> that we are going to use in our game engine. First of all, we are going to create an Event called <code>KeyDownEvent</code> that manage if any key is pressed and add some support for these events. To check that it works we have create the example [Event](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/event). We have also created the system <code>GridMovementSystem</code> to add some functionality to the event created before, and create another example <i>([Grid Movement](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/grid-movement))</i> to check it out.

Lastly, we have to do the [Exercise 12](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/exercise-12) where we need to implement a game that spaw some entities when we press a key. This procces must have the Event Bus support and some events created. The result obtained is as follows: 

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/blob/main/Screenshots/Exercise12.gif" alt="Exercise 12" height="300"/></p>

## Naming and Groupping

Sometimes we want to identify a entity by a <b>name</b> or some entities by the <b>group</b> they belong. To do so, we have create a new component called <code>NameGroupComponent</code> that add a name and a group name to the entities and be able to identify them. For this section, we have an example <i>([Names Groups](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/names-groups))</i> where we create some objects with a name and group, and depending their name, their behaviour varies. The exercise <i>([Exercise 13](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/exercise-13))</i> of this unit consists in add this new component in an example. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/blob/main/Screenshots/Exercise13.gif" alt="Exercise 13" height="300"/></p>

## Collisions

For our game engine we want to create a system that allow us to check the collisions between the objects we create. To do so, we need to be carefull about the performance of the calculations. We have create a helper called <code>Collisions</code> to know when there is a collision and how to resolve it. This helper has the following functions: 

- <b>IsColliding</b>: Check the type of objects that are colliding depending on the shapes and select a type of the following three coliisions.
- <b>IsCollidingCircleCircle</b>: Check if two circles are colliding.
- <b>IsCollidingPolygonolygon</b>: Check if two polygons are colliding.
- <b>IsCollidingPolygonCircle</b>: Check if a polygon is colliding with a circle.
- <b>ResolveCollision</b>: It determine how far the object will be moved.
- <b>ResolvePenetration</b>: It determine the impulse that the objects will have for not collide.

We have also create a <code>ColliderComponent</code> and a <code>CollisionSystem</code> to detect the collisions and to render the collisions if the user desire it. Also, we have determine that we are going to use the <b>Separating Axis Theorem</b> <i>(SAT)</i> to be able to resolve the collisions between objects that are rotate. The calculations used depends on the normal of each lateral of the shape. 

During the implementation of the codes, we have done different examples to check that all is right. Some of the examples are [Collision Detection Circle Circle 1/2](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/collision-detection-circle-circle-1), [Collision Detection Polygon 1/2/3](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/collision-detection-polygon-1), [Collision Penetration](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/collision-penetration) and [AABB Collision Detection](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/AABB-collision-detection). Finally, for this unit we have two exercises, the [Exercise 14](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/exercise-14) consists in implementing the Component, System and helper to be able to detect collisions and resolve them. The second exercise <i>([Exercise 15](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/exercise-15))</i> consists in determine some groups that will interact between them and by themselfs with a <code>CollisionEvent</code> and a <code>DamageSystem</code>.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/blob/main/Screenshots/Exercise15.gif" alt="Exercise 15" height="300"/></p>

## Fluid Simulations

We want to implement fluid simulations using <code>SPH</code> <i>(Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics)</i>. To do so, we have implement a new struct for the particles and the following functions: 

- <b>Init SPH</b>: Generate a column of particles.
- <b>Check Input</b>: If the user wants, it can be added more particles in the runtime.
- <b>Compute Density Pressure</b>: Calculate the density and pressure of the particles.
- <b>Compute Forces</b>: Calculate the sume of forces generate by the pressure and viscosity.
- <b>Integrate and Enfocer Boundaries</b>: Limit of the particles where they can move.
- <b>Render Scene</b>: Draw all the particles.

For this part we have implement the example [SPH](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/SPH) where we generate some particles that move like a fluid.

## Game Scripting

In this section, we have implement a producedural programming paradigm, where we will use Lua and SOL framwwork for binding with C++. First of all, we need to download Lua into our local drive and then, update the Makefile to support it. We have implement some examples to check that it works fine, these examples are [Setting up the Enviroment](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/setting-up-the-enviroment), [Loading Lua Script](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/loafing-lua-script), [Lua Functions](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/lua-functions) and [Game Snooker](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/game-snooker).

Later, we have implement a new <code>Script Component</code> and <code>Script System</code> to use functions created in the Lua script. Also, we have create a new function inside the Game Engine that create entities given a Lua script with a specific format. For this part we have three different examples: [Script Component 01](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/script-component-01), [Script Component 02](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/script-component-02) and [Script Component 03](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/script-component-03). Here we have learn how to use functions in the Lua script that are outside it and use stucts inside Lua.

Finaly, we have to do the [Exercise 16](https://github.com/Hobbit-Holes/Physics-Simulation-Engine/tree/main/MorgulEngine/exercises/exercise-16) where we need to add support to the Lua script and implement the new component and system. We have remade the snooker game from the Exercise 15 with this new method.
